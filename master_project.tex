\section{Experiments}
Two-level schedulers have been proven to deal badly with long scheduling decision times and
when resources are not freed frequently, providing a non-optimal utilization of the resources
of the cluster.

Omega doesn't have a clear policy to mediate between frameworks to provide coordination so 
that the execution can be improved.

Examples of situations where some global policies can improve the performance of the cluster:

 - A job takes most of the resources but it won't finish soon while other jobs would finish
   quickly but they are not given the opportunity to use the resources
 - A job that many other jobs depend on is ignored while other job whose execution is less
   relevant is executed first
 - A job that can run dynamically adjusting it's size takes resources of other job that needs
  a fixed amount

How many of those examples cannot be resolved with priorities?
