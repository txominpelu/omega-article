\section{Introduction}

Scheduling is planning the execution of a set of computations that
are called jobs in an execution environment with a limited amount of
resources.

If we consider the size of the clusters of the biggest companies
in the web, their resource consumption and the economical value of the
applications that run on them we can quickly realize of the
economical, ecological and business impact of a good utilization of
these clusters that depends significantly on the quality of
the schedulers that allocate their resources.

Besides, with the advention of the cloud platforms the ``prestation'' of clusters
has become a business in itself. Initially thought for hosting
webservers, databases and distributed services virtual machines
are finding other uses for their computational resources such as
distributed parallel processing that increases the possibility
of manipulate and make sense out of bigger amounts of data. This
different uses of cluster resources increases
even more the importance of the process of scheduling as well of the
complexity to handle all the different kinds of applications.

This relevance of the scheduling process constitutes a good
''incentivation'' for the scientific community to try to find the best
scheduling strategies to optimize the utilization of clusters. An
incentivation that can be facilitated by the public release of the
traces of the clusters of many big companies like [ref] that allow
anyone interested in testing improvements to the existing scheduling
models to try them against the real production traces of the clusters
of the biggest companies.

%% Difficulties

Scheduling has a great impact in the well functioning of a cluster in
terms of quality of service and running costs.  Unfortunately
designing a cluster scheduler is a difficult task. Many types
of applications can run in a cluster, with completely different
scheduling strategies that the scheduler needs to support while
remaining simple a fast enough to deal with the increasing size of
the clusters and the tighter scheduling deadlines imposed by recent
data processing frameworks.

Besides, the scheduler needs to able to deal with conflicts when many
applications try to use the same resource at the same time and manage
to offer every application a fair share of the resources of the cluster
according to a list of defined criteria.

Previous approaches to scheduling either have problems to deal with 
having to run a diversity of applications, cannot scale when a cluster
grows or don't achieve a high utilization of the resources. Two level 
schedulers like Mesos \cite{Hindman10mesos:a} do provide scalability 
and flexibility to run different applications but have some limitations when
trying to achieve a good utilization of the resources of the cluster
due to the pessimistic lock that is held with their offers and can reach
deadlocks when two applications do resource hoarding. Omega \cite{41684}
offers a more open model based on optimistic locking that avoids the 
inconveniences of the two level model. However only the model behind Omega
has been publicly exposed, so no available implementation exists that can
be used to test Omega in different contexts. Besides, the Omega paper
does not propose an explanation to achieve fairness in the context where
frameworks compete for the same resource or how they avoid problems with
``rogue'' frameworks apart from a basic notion of priority for the former 
and post-facto monitoring for the latter.


%% Be careful cause the simulator could be considered as such implementation

In section \ref{sec:approaches} I will describe the archetypical situation
that a cluster scheduler faces in a datacenter and I will show how the
existing approaches that have been proposed till the moment deal with it,
showing their negative and their positive aspects.

\section{Archetypical situation}

Thanks to big companies like Google \ref, Yahoo \ref and Facebook \ref that
have published the traces of their clusters, it is possible today to
have an idea of the activity that happens today in a standard datacenter.
In this section I'll define a characterization of this activity based on
the published traces that I'll use in section \ref{sec:approaches} to 
compare how the more relevant strategies that have been used historically
to schedule jobs in a cluster behave in face of the situation described
by the characterization.

According to Google's traces, cluster's run mainly two group of jobs that
are characterized by their duration. Most jobs last less than 30 minutes
and are mainly MapReduce \ref jobs while a smaller amount of jobs last
more than 18 hours and consume most of the cluster's resources. Yahoo's
and Facebook's traces reveal the same aggregation of tasks between these
clearly differentiated two groups.

Qualitatively speaking the jobs from the first group are mainly parallel
data processing jobs that belong to a myriad of frameworks that includes
MapReduce frameworks like Hadoop, graph processing architectures like
Giraph or Pregel, those specialized for incremental processing like Spark, 
google's Dremel, and Percolator but also MPI jobs. An heterogenous group
of frameworks that uses completely different strategies to scheduler their
tasks. The jobs from the second group require usually high availability and
have more difficult placement constraints what often means that their tasks
take longer to be scheduled.

The traces released by google and publicly accesible at \ref belong to
cluster's with more than eleven thousand machines where rates arrive
at a pace of %%FIXME%% 
per second, however this traces were released in 2011 so
today's numbers have probably increased significantly.


\section{Existing approaches}
\label{sec:approaches}

\subsection{Solutions for coordinated cluster scheduling}

In the following section we will explain some of the existing models
of cluster schedulers considering their advantages and disadvantages
having into account the criteria introduced in the previous
section. Finally we will introduce the model Omega \cite{41684}
proposed by engineers at google that aims to overcome many of the
limitations of the other approaches.

\subsubsection{Centralized scheduler}

The first schedulers were designed following a monolithic architecture
with a central scheduler taking care of distributing the execution
of jobs across the nodes of the cluster. This design has, at least in
the beginning, the advantage of being simple since there's only one
scheduler assigning resources. The central scheduler controls the
state of the whole cluster, what makes it capable of taking really
good scheduling decisions specially when all jobs have the same
scheduling requirements. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25,natwidth=960,natheight=720]{CentralizedScheduler.png}
  \caption{Centralized Scheduler}
  \label{fig:centralized}
\end{figure}

However this design that is simple and capable of taking good
decisions in the beginning, has many problems as the size of the
cluster increases or as the jobs executed in the cluster
diversify. When the number of jobs to execute increases, the central
scheduler needs to be able to keep with the pace of jobs that are
planned. On top of that a single scheduler represents a single point
of failure. Parallelization can atenuate both problems but just at the
expense of adding complexity and introducing the need for synchronization
between the schedulers.

Above all, for a centralized scheduler it is difficult to adapt
adequately to the heterogeinity of jobs that is executed in today's
clusters \cite{37201}. Trying to define different
scheduling paths for the different types of workloads is difficult
because it requires algorithms to identify the type of a job, and comes
at the expense of the scheduler's complexity. Some schedulers try to
support different policies by implement really complex algorithms
involving different weighting factors that provide rough
approximations of the objectives of every kind of workload. Others
like google's run different scheduling logic for every kind of
workload but it usually implies that users of the scheduler need to
have a really good understanding of the internals of the scheduling
algorithm to be able to optimize the execution of jobs. In both cases
the solution implies an additional layer of complexity to an already
difficult task.

Besides this model requires modifying the code of the scheduler every
time a new type of workload appears. 

Advantages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Control over the whole cluster. The scheduler is capable of taking good scheduling decisions.
  \item Good cluster utilization
  \item Simplest solution when there's only one framework running in the cluster
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Single point of failure
  \item Doesn't scale. The central scheduler is a bottleneck and
    slower jobs block other jobs that are faster to schedule.
  \item Can't adapt to new frameworks with new policies and needs
  \item Complexity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static partitioning}

To overcome the limitations that the previous model had when dealing
with clusters where the are many kinds of jobs with different scheduling
needs, static partitioning allows to split the resources of the cluster
in as many partitions as the kinds of jobs that we want to
treat independently. This strategy is attractive because it allows to
have an optimized dedicated scheduler for every kind while being
relatively simple since every scheduler manages its portion of the
cluster without any risk of conflicts with the others. It was
for a while the model chosen by companies like Yahoo.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25,natwidth=960,natheight=720]{StaticPartitioning.png}
  \caption{Static Partitioning}
  \label{fig:static_partitioning}
\end{figure}

Nonetheless this strategy's drawback is that since the different 
categories run in different, isolated portions of the cluster the
resources of the cluster are wasted since it is not possible for
a partition to use the resources that another partition is not using.

Advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple
    \item Every framework can use their specific scheduler that is specialized
    \item There's no possibility of conflicts between frameworks when
      accessing the resources
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Difficult to decide what is the right partition of the resources
between frameworks
  \item Non-optimal utilization of the resources of the cluster, for example
if one of the frameworks is idle other framework cannot use those
available resources since the repartition is done statically
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two-Level scheduler}

Two level schedulers give applications, also called
frameworks, the ability to schedule their tasks independently while
having access to all the resources available in the cluster. This
is achieved with an architecture that is based in a master that manages
the cluster's resources and offers them to the frameworks who can accept 
the offers, notifying the master of the tasks they want to run and the
resources they want to run them on, or reject them.

The resources of the cluster are provided by the slaves that register to 
the master at startup providing information about the amount of memory, CPU
and network bandwidth  that they put at master's disposal.  

Frameworks can satisfy their needs (for example data locality \cite{chung_maximizing_2006} ) by 
rejecting the offers that don't interest them and accepting those who do, thus
ensuring per framework needs despite a centralized resource manager. 

When the interests of two frameworks conflict, for example two
frameworks want to run their jobs in the same slave because they both
access the same data, there are techniques to ensure that all
frameworks can have their fair share of the resources they need. In
the case of data processing jobs where tasks don't take long to
execute a technique called delay scheduling \cite{zaharia_delay_2010}
manages to provide good data locality for the tasks without delaying
the execution of the whole job. Nonetheless, when two competing
frameworks use resource hoarding to incrementally acquire resources
before they start a job deadlocks can emerge.

At the cluster level, global policies are enforced by the way that the
master distributes the offers to the frameworks. A cluster manager
like Mesos \cite{Hindman10mesos:a} provides two policies one based on
fairness \cite{AjtaiANRSW1998} and another on strict priorities,
custom policies can also be implemented. However if this policies are
too simple the central scheduler of Mesos can be extended with new
policies.

Fail-over on the master is provided with machines that run as backups of the master and
are capable to restore the master's state when it falls. Schedulers and slaves can find
the new master to register to with centralized configuration services like Zookeeper \cite{_apache_????}.

Partitioning of the resources of the cluster is provided thanks to Linux containers \cite{_linux_????}
an isolation technique that allows to run processes in an allocated subset of the 
resources of the machine without interferences from other processes. 

An optimization to the model of resource offers is the possibility for the frameworks
to define filters that describe the kinds of offers that a framework will not be interested
in, this way avoiding unnecessary exchanges between the slaves and the masters.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25,natwidth=960,natheight=720]{TwoLevel.png}
  \caption{Two Level Scheduler}
  \label{fig:two_level}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Execution process}

A simple example where we have only one framework that wants to run a 
job formed by a single task will serve to explain all the steps that happen
before a computation can take place in the cluster:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Master starts. One of the candidates is selected as the master and 
the others remain as backup masters that will take the place of the current leader in
case it fails. The leader will start listening to the registration of slaves and 
frameworks.
\item The slaves start. They find the current master through a distributed configuration 
service and they register themselves by notifying the resources the put at the disposal
of the cluster.
\item The framework is launched. To execute its job the framework
  first registers to the master and starts listening to resource
  offers.
\item Since our framework is alone in the cluster, the master makes an offer with
all the resources available to our framework.
\item The framework receives the offer and accepts it. It does so by responding to the
offer with a list of the tasks that it wants to run specifying for every task: how to 
execute the task and what resources will be dedicated to the execution.
The response will only be valid if the resources assigned to all the tasks are a subset
of the resources offered by the master.
\item When the master receives the proposition to run the tasks. It
  allocates the requested resources inside containers in the slaves
  specified in the response and it launches the process to compute the
  task. To be able to run the tasks the slave obviously needs to have
  access to the binaries to run the process what is usually done
  either making the binaries accessible to the whole cluster through a
  distributed filesystem like the Google File System
  \cite{ghemawat_google_2003} or Amazon's S3 \cite{_aws_????} or by
  ensuring manually that the slaves have all the binaries in a public
  accessible folder.
\item Once the computation has finished the slave notifies the master that the resources
are available again so the master can continue offering them to the frameworks.
\end{enumerate}

%% (add diagram over how mesos works?)

Advantages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Really simple central scheduler (master in Mesos terms) that has
  fail-over 
 \item
  Flexible: every framework decides how it schedules its tasks, the
  master only offers resources following fairness 
 \item
  Through offer rejection, frameworks can achieve high data locality
  only accepting offers that correspond to nodes where the data is
  stored. To avoid waiting indefinitely a technique called delayed
  scheduling \cite{zaharia_delay_2010} has proved to achieve high data locality without
  sacrificing job execution time benefiting from the fact that tasks in
  data processing frameworks like Hadoop or MPI are short so resources
  are freed frequently.
 \item Scalability
 \item Specialized for jobs with high chunk and where schedulers don't take
too long. With this kind of job, resources are freed frequently and
every framework gets its fair share of the cluster.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
 \item This kind of scheduling encourages frameworks to demand more
   resources than they actually need in preparation for everything
   they want to run. If a framework wants to run a list of tasks in
   many steps it will demand resources for the whole process even if
   many resources will be idle during most steps.
 \item Difficult to place picky jobs, for example to do gang scheduling
frameworks in Mesos need to do resource hoarding what can lead to
deadlocks
 \item When a framework is offered some resources it
holds the lock for the resource for the time the offer is
available. If a framework hoards the resources or takes a long
time to respond all other frameworks that are actually ready to accept
the offer and execute their jobs will have to wait for the first
framework to respond to the offer.

For example in clusters that run service jobs or jobs with complex
placement constraints that take long time to schedule the performance
of two-level schedulers suffers.

 \item Framework schedulers are written in an indirect style. They
  take actions only when the resources are offered. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Offer-all vs Fair-share offers}

\section{Optimistic locking}

Another approach to cluster scheduling that tries to overcome some of
the limitations of the pessimistic locking of two-level schedulers is
the optimistic locking approach proposed by Google's Omega
scheduler.

The idea behind Omega is to make the state of the cluster available to
every scheduler through a data structure that its called cell
state. When one of the frameworks wants to run a job in the cluster it
tries to commit a lock for the resources needed to run the job's
tasks. If the resource has already been taken by another framework
since the last update, the framework receives the updated version of
the cluster and it can retry a commit of available resources. With
this approach every scheduler has an overall view of the cluster what
allows them to make better scheduling decisions while having a
mediation mechanism when two frameworks want to commit for the same 
resources.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25,natwidth=960,natheight=720]{Omega.png}
  \caption{Omega Scheduler}
  \label{fig:two_level}
\end{figure}

Since with this approach the state of the cluster is publicly exposed all the
time for any framework to see, many of the problems that stem from the 
pessimistic locking nature of two level schedulers are avoided.  Frameworks
that take a long time to schedule are no longer a problem since they don't
hold any lock over any resource while they're taking the decision. Besides,
frameworks waiting for an offer no longer have to wait for their turn if they
have a task ready to schedule, they can request the resources as soon as they
know what resources they need and what tasks they will run on them. Frameworks
that don't have any task to run at the moment don't make other frameworks wait
and don't need to worry about responding negatively to offers, they can just
focus on the core of their activity.

Besides, the centralized model behind Omega is way simpler than the
model based on offers used by Mesos. In its basic version, Omega
represents just a thin layer that manages conflict resolution for
concurrent access to cluster's resources. This simplicity makes it
easy for the implementation of a scheduler based on the Omega model to
scale to bigger clusters or higher task interarrival rates.

However, the freedom that the Omega provides for frameworks to
allocate resources in its basic version comes with a drawback when
comparing it with the two level model. While in the two level model,
the master manages what resources are offered to what framework, in
its basic version Omega only accepts or rejects framework's demands
based on wether the resources are available or not.  Therefore Omega
have no way to enforce that the repartition of resources between
frameworks is fair, or that higher priority tasks don't have to wait
for lower priority tasks.

FIXME:
- Higher visibility allows frameworks more flexibility when playing 
games and thus to reach a more satisfactory equilibrium. Game theory?
- Scheduling is bin packing - Write a remark about this?

\subsection{Omega Limitations}

In its simplest version Omega was implemented without incremental
resource allocation for tasks and without fine grained resource
management just like the first version implemented for Omega in
[ref]. This version had limitations ...

But even with incremental resource allocation and fine grained
resource management Omega has some limitations, specially as the
cluster ``utilization'' grows and the possibility for conflicts
increases. When dealing with conflicts between tasks there are some
factors to consider:

 \begin{itemize}
   \item (Task duration)If the tasks that conflict (or just the one that is
   running) take minutes to finish, seconds or milliseconds If the
  \item Tasks have different priority levels If the tasks are allowed to be
  preempted or not (if they have high availability requirements they
  can't *Note1*)
 \end{itemize}

   
*Note1* : Would it be useful if tasks could be associated an acceptable downtime threshold?
*Note2* : When two services (higher priority) compete for overlapping resources what to do?
 - The first one takes it and the other one doesn't get anything
 - Sharing the cluster time (usually not satisfactory)
 - Raise an alarm (unexpected situation - impossible to resolve appropriately)
%% Can Omega be a general model that can be used to emulate other scheduling techniques (e.g
%% Mesos, Sparrow..)
 
When frameworks want to schedule tasks in the cluster they could either specify the required
machines or allow to fallback to the given amount of resources without considering specific
tasks. It's important that in the case where the cluster provides a fallback mechanism 
this should be as simple as possible (for example just taking any other free machine).


\subsection{Priorities}

A really simple yet fairly powerful way to consider business needs
when many frameworks want to use the same resources at the same time
is assigning priorities. In the competition for resources, tasks with
higher priorities will always win against lower priority tasks. In the
case where lower priority taks have already their resources assigned
preemption will be used to ensure that the order is respected and that
low priority tasks don't slow down high priority tasks even if this
causes some overhead for the duplicated effort that lower priority
tasks need to do when they're preempted.

In practice this works well because by assigning the higher priority
to the services, that provide the higher business value [ref], we can
ensure their high availability since no other job can preempt them,
and give them exactly the resources they need. Assigning the Lower
priority levels to batch jobs works well because jobs are usually less
important than services but specially because they're more flexible in
the allocation of their tasks, and they deal well with preemption.

\subsection{Fairness}

Omega overcomes some of the limitations of the other
scheduling strategies, however in it's basic version it doesn't
provide any control mechanism to ensure that the repartition of
resources between the frameworks is fair or to avoid misbehaving
frameworks monopolizing the control of cluster's resources.

This problem has already appeared in the context of cluster scheduling
and the solution most generally accepted is Dominant Resource Fairness
(DRF) \ref[] that has already been applied to the Mesos two level
scheduler. DRF considers that users care about the number of tasks
they're allocated. The number of tasks allocated for a framework
depends itself on dominant resource that is the resource that
relatively demands most from the cluster, said otherwise the resource
that demands a higher proportion of the cluster for a type of
task. The number of tasks allocated to a user depends on the dominant
resource because it is the one that will be relatively allocated most
of the cluster. DRF attemps therefore to give all users an equal
amount of their dominant resources.

To explain DRF I will use the model of a cluster as a simplified
environment already used at \ref where there are $n$ users
$u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{n}$ and the cluster is represented by a vector of
resources $R_{1},R_{2}...,R_{m}$. Each user $i$ has a \emph{demand
  vector} $D_{i}$, which describes its absolute per task consumption,
e.g., $D_{2} = \langle 3, 2, 1 \rangle$ means that user $u_{2}$ tasks
require 3 units of resource $R_{1}$, 2 units of resource $R_{2}$ and 1
unit of resource $R_{3}$. A user is always given resources as
multiples of its demand vector and allocation is denoted as $A =
\langle a_{1},...,a_{n} \rangle$ what means that user $u_{i}$ gets to
run $a_{i}$ tasks, dimensioned according to its demand vector
$D_{i}$. To simplify, scheduling is considered over an infinite task
demand (i.e. $d_{i} = \infty$).

Formally in DRF each user $i$ has a \emph{dominant share} $x_{i}$ ,
which is $i's$ share of its dominant resource, i.e. $x_{i} = max_{j}\{s_{i,j}\}$,
where $s_{i,j}$ is user $i$'s fractional share of resource $j$, where
$s_{i,j} = a_{i}D_{i,j}/r_{j}$.

%% Before we see how Omega can be modified to support a control mechanism
%% to ensure fairness I will give a list of criteria that are used in
%% microeconomics \ref to qualify repartition of resources as fair and that
%% we will apply to our context of cluster's resources:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pareto Optimality (PO)
  \item Sharing Incentives 
  \item Envy-Freeness
  \item Strategyproofness
\end{itemize}

\section{Other responsabilities of the scheduler}

Scheduling as an abstraction layer for distribution?

Scheduling also consists in providing an abstraction layer for
computations to execute their jobs in a distributed environment
without having to manage the distribution of the computations
or the binaries to execute them.

Abstraction for the execution of tasks in multiple machines (e.g API)
  - Run this in machine X
  - Run this in machine X with X CPUs and Y GB Ram
  - Communicate with my other task with id X (the cluster should figure out where the task is)
  - Autorecover if task fails (if failure is due to the tasks retry n times, if it is due
    to a machine find another machine for the task)
    
This has allowed to implement on top of the scheduler / resource manager:

  - Batch and stream based data processing frameworks (e.g Spark, Hadoop)
  - Distributed webs with automatic loadbalancing (e.g Marathon + Play)
  - Distributed disk based and memory based file systems (e.g hdfs and tachyon)
  - Distributed build systems (jenkins)

\section{Experiments}
Two-level schedulers have been proven to deal badly with long scheduling decision times and
when resources are not freed frequently, providing a non-optimal utilization of the resources
of the cluster.

Omega doesn't have a clear policy to mediate between frameworks to provide coordination so 
that the execution can be improved.

Examples of situations where some global policies can improve the performance of the cluster:

 - A job takes most of the resources but it won't finish soon while other jobs would finish
   quickly but they are not given the opportunity to use the resources
 - A job that many other jobs depend on is ignored while other job whose execution is less
   relevant is executed first
 - A job that can run dynamically adjusting it's size takes resources of other job that needs
  a fixed amount

How many of those examples cannot be resolved with priorities?
