Final Goals


  - Execute Jobs within given constraints

    Mainly two types of jobs with completely different requirements:

    - Service jobs: long running, resource consuming, require low-latency, high availability
    - Batch jobs: 
      - short running, to finish as soon as possible 
      - splitted in multiple smaller tasks that can be usually parallelized and distributed 
      (They usually process data that is distributed across a cluster so they benefit from 
      data locality (explain what it is), 
      - represent around 80% of the jobs in a cluster 
      - cannot afford delays in the scheduling

  - Maximize the utilization of the cluster

One or many schedulers?

Requirements for a scheduler

  - Respond to scheduling needs (job constraints)
  - Be flexible to respond to the different needs of the frameworks that will run in the
    cluster
  - Be quick (delays will affect the performance of the cluster. e.g delays in scheduling
    hadoop tasks can really affect the performance since there are thousands of task per job)
  - Scale when the cluster grows
  - Be simple (Ideally)
